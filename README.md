# A Moodle plugin for Automated Assessment in Data Structures
This project will focus on the development of new question types for Moodle quizzes. The
questions will allow students to write tests about Binary Search Trees, Binary Heaps, AVL
Trees and Sorting. The plugin will support the automatic generation of questions and will
be able to randomly generate questions within a specific format so that students writing tests
can be given their own version of the relevant questions. The plugin will include a widget allowing students and lecturers to construct and edit trees.

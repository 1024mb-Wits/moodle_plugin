## Tree plugin

This plugin can currently support the following features: 

A lecturer should be able to create a new question of type AVL.
A lecturer should be able to alter the settings of the question they create; they will be able to choose what the question content actually is in terms of theory.
A lecturer will be able to add the question they have created to quizzes or assessments on Moodle.

A lecturer and a student should be able to construct and edit an AVL tree using the HTML widget provided by the plugin. The actions they can perform include:

* adding nodes to the canvas
* adding edges between nodes on the canvas
* dragging nodes across the canvas
* deleting nodes and edges from the canvas
* editing the value of nodes on the canvas


In later sprints, the plugin will be upgraded to automatically mark any answers submitted by the student.
